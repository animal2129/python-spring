## Input file

The data used for this assignment can be downloaded from [cinderella.txt](cinderella.txt). Once you have downloaded the dataset, copy it to the same folder where you write your Python script.

If you are not sure in which directory Jupyter notebook is working from, you can run the following:

```python
# import the package os (operating system functions)
import os
# get the current working directory
cwd = os.getcwd()
# print it
print('Currently working in folder', cwd)
```

## Assignment

Look at the question/answer on Stackoverflow on how to read a file into a list [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277503/in-python-how-do-i-read-a-file-line-by-line-into-a-list](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3277503/in-python-how-do-i-read-a-file-line-by-line-into-a-list):

Run the following code:

```python
# this assumes that the file 'cinderella.txt' is in the same folder as your ipynb script 
fname = "cinderella.txt"
with open(fname) as f:
    content = f.readlines()
# you may also want to remove whitespace characters like `\n` at the end of each line
content = [x.strip() for x in content]

# print the first few lines
for line in content[0:5]:
	print(line)
```

The above code will read the cinderella poem into a list of strings, and will print the first 5 lines.

## Required

Write code to answer the following questions:

- how many words are in the poem
- how many words start with an uppercase letter
- does the Prince cry? (is there a line that contains both Prince and 'cried')

Also, write the lines that contain 'Prince' to another file (prince.txt). Adapt the following code that writes some text to a new file:

```python
with open('prince.txt', 'a') as the_file:
    the_file.write('Hello dear Prince\n')
```
### Detecting uppercase letter

Suppose you have a variable `line`, and you want to see if each word in that line starts with an uppercase letter or not, you can use the following code (as a starting point)

```python
line = "My Prince cries a lot"
words = line.split(" ")
for word in words:
    print(word, 'is uppercase?', word[0].isupper() )
```

which outputs:

```
My is uppercase? True
Prince is uppercase? True
cries is uppercase? False
a is uppercase? False
lot is uppercase? False
```

In other words, you can see if the first letter (`word[0]`) is uppercase or not.
